# Template-repository
A template repository that can be used to create other OPS repos.

## Required Files:

### README.md
This is the descriptor file, detailing what the repo is.

### LICENSE
All repos must have a license applied. The license file in this template is purposefully blank so that no license is automatically applied. Please carefully select and apply a license when creating a new repo.

### CONTRIBUTE.md
This file documents the best practices for others to contribute to the repo. All repos that expect open source contributions should have a detailed CONTRIBUTE file.
